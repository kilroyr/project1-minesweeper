Description
Minesweeper is single-player logic-based computer game played on rectangular board whose object is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed "mines" in the shortest possible time by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines. If the player clicks on a mine, the game ends.

Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: https://project1-minesweeper.vercel.app/
Left click to open tiles
Right click to flag tiles you think have bombs

Next Steps
1. Dark mode
2. A feature on some minesweeper websites where the first tile click will always flood. As sometimes if you are unlucky you will click on a bomb on your first click or open a tile that does not give you much information.
